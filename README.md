## User Story: 

AS A person interested in national parks and historic sites
I WANT to access a polished mobile-first UI to easily search for historic sites and/or national parks either by location, or by name.
SO THAT I can view information such as fees, activities, description, and designation - and view my last 5 saved searches.

WHEN I open the site
THEN I am presented with a map with pre-loaded plot points of 466 historic parks and sites

THEN I am presented with a button 'View More'
WHEN I click 'View More' 
THEN the site is populated with the following fields:
    Name
    Designation
    Description
    Entrance Fee
    Activites
    + an image of the park

WHEN I search by specific park name by using the search bar
